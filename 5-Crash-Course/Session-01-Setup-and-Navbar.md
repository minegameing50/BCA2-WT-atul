## 🎯 What We'll Build Today

Today we lay the **foundation** of our class website — **"BCA Batch 2025-26 — Our Class Website."**

Think of the navbar as the **reception desk at the entrance of Mandsaur University**. When someone walks in, the first thing they see is the reception — it tells them where to go: the BCA Department, the library, the canteen, the exam hall. Our navbar does the exact same job for a website. It's the very first thing a visitor sees, and it guides them to every section of the page.

Here's a text-based wireframe of what we'll create:

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  BCA 2025-26    Home  About  Faculty  Timetable  Gallery  Contact  More ▾  │
│                                                                     FAQ    │
│                                                                     Login  │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

                    Welcome to BCA Batch 2025-26!
              Our class website is coming soon... one section at a time! 🚀
```

**On mobile (small screens), it transforms into:**

```
┌──────────────────────┐
│  BCA 2025-26    ☰    │
└──────────────────────┘
   (tap ☰ to reveal all links)
```

By the end of this session, you'll have a **fully responsive navigation bar** that works on desktops, tablets, and phones — all without writing a single line of CSS yourself. Welcome to the power of Bootstrap!

## 📌 New HTML Tags in This Session

Every tag below is appearing **for the first time** in our crash course. Don't worry if they seem overwhelming — we'll explain each one in detail as we use it.

| # | Tag | What It Does | Real-World Analogy |
|---|-----|-------------|-------------------|
| 1 | `<!DOCTYPE html>` | Declares this is an HTML5 document | The cover page of a textbook — tells you what's inside |
| 2 | `<html>` | Root container for all HTML content | The building itself — everything is inside it |
| 3 | `<head>` | Contains metadata (info *about* the page, not visible content) | The back cover / spine of a book — title, author, ISBN |
| 4 | `<meta>` | Provides metadata like character set and viewport settings | The "specifications" label on a product box |
| 5 | `<title>` | Sets the text shown on the browser tab | The name plate on your hostel room door |
| 6 | `<link>` | Connects external files (like CSS stylesheets) | Plugging a charger into your phone — it brings power (styles) from outside |
| 7 | `<body>` | Contains all visible content on the page | The pages inside a book — what the reader actually sees |
| 8 | `<nav>` | Defines a navigation section | The reception desk / directory board at a building entrance |
| 9 | `<div>` | A generic container to group elements | A cardboard box — it holds things together |
| 10 | `<a>` | Creates a clickable hyperlink | A signboard pointing to a room — "BCA Department → 2nd Floor" |
| 11 | `<button>` | Creates a clickable button | A doorbell — press it and something happens |
| 12 | `<span>` | An inline container for small pieces of content | A sticky note on a page — highlights a small piece |
| 13 | `<ul>` | Creates an unordered (bulleted) list | A menu card at a restaurant — a list of items |
| 14 | `<li>` | A single item inside a list | One dish on the menu card |
| 15 | `<script>` | Embeds or links JavaScript code | The electrical wiring of a building — invisible but makes things work |

## 📖 What is Bootstrap?

### The IKEA Analogy 🪑

Imagine you want to build a **bookshelf** for your hostel room.

**Option A — The Hard Way (Raw CSS):**
You go to the timber market in Mandsaur, buy raw wood planks, measure everything yourself, cut each piece with a saw, sand it smooth, paint it, drill holes, and assemble it. It might take you 2 days and it might be a bit wobbly.

**Option B — The IKEA Way (Bootstrap):**
You buy a pre-made kit where every piece of wood is already cut to the perfect size, screws are included, and you get a step-by-step assembly guide. You just follow the instructions and in 30 minutes, you have a beautiful bookshelf.

**Bootstrap is the IKEA of web design.** It gives you pre-made, ready-to-use components — navbars, buttons, cards, forms, grids — and you just assemble them using CSS class names. No need to write hundreds of lines of CSS from scratch!

### What Bootstrap IS

Bootstrap is a **free, open-source CSS + JavaScript framework** originally created by developers at Twitter. It provides:

- **Pre-written CSS** — Hundreds of utility classes like `text-center`, `bg-dark`, `mt-5` that you simply add to your HTML
- **Pre-built Components** — Navbars, carousels, modals, cards, accordions — all ready to use
- **JavaScript Plugins** — Dropdowns, collapse animations, tooltips — interactive features without writing JS yourself
- **A Grid System** — A 12-column layout system that makes responsive design simple

### Why Use Bootstrap?

| Reason | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Responsive by default** | Your website automatically looks good on phones, tablets, and desktops |
| **Consistent UI** | Every button, card, and navbar follows the same design language |
| **Saves time** | What would take 200 lines of CSS takes 2-3 class names in Bootstrap |
| **Cross-browser** | Works the same in Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari |
| **Huge community** | Millions of developers use it — help is always available on Google |

### Bootstrap 5 vs Bootstrap 4

We're using **Bootstrap 5.3.2** (the latest stable version). The biggest change from Bootstrap 4:

| Feature | Bootstrap 4 | Bootstrap 5 |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| jQuery dependency | Required jQuery | **No jQuery needed!** ✅ |
| CSS approach | Mostly component-based | More utility-first classes |
| Grid system | Flexbox | Flexbox (improved) |
| Form controls | Basic styling | Floating labels, better validation |

> 💡 **Why does "no jQuery" matter?** jQuery was an extra JavaScript library (about 90 KB) that Bootstrap 4 needed to work. Bootstrap 5 removed this dependency, making your website load faster. Less baggage = better performance!

### How to Include Bootstrap (CDN)

CDN stands for **Content Delivery Network** — think of it as a **public library** where Bootstrap files are stored on servers around the world. Instead of downloading Bootstrap to your computer, you simply include a link and the browser fetches it automatically.

You need **two** CDN links:

**1. Bootstrap CSS** (goes inside `<head>`) — This gives you all the styling:
```html
<link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.2/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
```

**2. Bootstrap JS Bundle** (goes just before `</body>`) — This makes interactive components work (dropdowns, hamburger collapse, etc.):
```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.2/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script>
```

> ⚠️ **Order matters!** CSS goes in `<head>` (so styles load before content appears). JavaScript goes at the bottom of `<body>` (so it runs after all HTML is loaded).

### The Concept of Utility Classes

Bootstrap works through **CSS classes** that you add to your HTML elements. These are called **utility classes** because each one does exactly one thing:

| Class | What It Does | Plain CSS Equivalent |
|-------|-------------|---------------------|
| `text-center` | Centers text | `text-align: center;` |
| `bg-dark` | Dark background color | `background-color: #212529;` |
| `mt-5` | Adds large top margin | `margin-top: 3rem;` |
| `ms-auto` | Pushes element to the right | `margin-left: auto;` |
| `text-muted` | Makes text grey/subtle | `color: #6c757d;` |

Instead of writing CSS in a separate file, you simply add these class names directly in your HTML. This is the core idea behind Bootstrap!

## 📖 Understanding the HTML Boilerplate

Every HTML file starts with the same basic structure — we call this the **boilerplate**. Think of it as the **foundation and walls of a house** — you need them before you can add furniture (content).

Here's the complete boilerplate for our project:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>BCA Batch 2025-26 | Our Class</title>
    <link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.2/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
</head>
<body>

    <!-- Content goes here -->

    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.2/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

Let's understand **every single line**:

---

> 📌 **First Time Seeing `<!DOCTYPE html>`?**
>
> This tells the browser: *"Hey, this is an HTML5 document!"* Think of it as the **cover page of a BCA exam answer sheet** — before you start writing answers, you write "BCA Semester II" on top so the evaluator knows what it is.
>
> - It's **not** actually an HTML tag — it's a **declaration**
> - Every HTML file **must** start with this line
> - Without it, the browser might render your page in "quirks mode" (an older, unpredictable way)
> - It's always written exactly as `<!DOCTYPE html>` — no variations

---

> 📌 **First Time Seeing `<html lang="en">`?**
>
> The `<html>` tag is the **root element** — the outermost container that wraps everything on the page. Think of it as the **building itself** — every room (head, body) is inside this building.
>
> - `lang="en"` tells the browser the page is in English
> - This helps screen readers (for visually impaired users) pronounce words correctly
> - It also helps Google understand what language your content is in
> - You always close it at the very end: `</html>`

---

> 📌 **First Time Seeing `<head>`?**
>
> The `<head>` section contains **metadata** — information *about* the page that is **not visible** on screen. Think of it as the **back cover of a book** — it has the ISBN, publisher info, and edition number, but readers don't see it while reading.
>
> Inside `<head>`, we put:
> - Character encoding (`<meta charset>`)
> - Viewport settings for mobile (`<meta viewport>`)
> - The page title (`<title>`)
> - Links to external CSS files (`<link>`)
>
> Nothing inside `<head>` appears on the actual webpage.

---

> 📌 **First Time Seeing `<meta charset="UTF-8">`?**
>
> This tells the browser **which character encoding to use**. UTF-8 supports virtually every character from every language — English, Hindi (हिंदी), Chinese, Arabic, emojis (🎓), and more.
>
> Think of it as choosing the **right keyboard layout** — if you pick the wrong one, the text appears as `Ã¢â‚¬â€œ` garbage instead of proper characters.
>
> - Always use `UTF-8` — it's the universal standard
> - Without this, Hindi text or special characters on your page might break

---

> 📌 **First Time Seeing `<meta name="viewport" ...>`?**
>
> This is the **most important line for mobile responsiveness**. Without it, your website will look like a tiny desktop page zoomed out on a phone.
>
> ```html
> <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
> ```
>
> - `width=device-width` → Make the page width match the device's screen width
> - `initial-scale=1.0` → Don't zoom in or out — show at 100% scale
>
> **Real-world analogy:** Imagine watching a movie meant for a cinema screen on your phone. Without this tag, the phone tries to show the entire cinema-sized page, making everything unreadably tiny. With this tag, the page adjusts itself to fit your phone screen perfectly.
>
> **Fun fact:** Before smartphones, this tag didn't exist! It was introduced by Apple when the first iPhone launched in 2007.

---

> 📌 **First Time Seeing `<title>`?**
>
> The `<title>` tag sets the text that appears on the **browser tab**. It's also what Google shows as the **clickable heading** in search results.
>
> Think of it as the **name plate on your hostel room door** — people see it before they walk in.
>
> ```html
> <title>BCA Batch 2025-26 | Our Class</title>
> ```
>
> - Keep it short and descriptive (50-60 characters max)
> - It does NOT appear on the page itself — only on the browser tab
> - Great for SEO (Search Engine Optimization)

---

> 📌 **First Time Seeing `<link>`?**
>
> The `<link>` tag connects an **external resource** (like a CSS file) to your HTML page. It does NOT create a clickable link — that's the `<a>` tag's job.
>
> Think of it as **plugging a charger into your phone** — you're bringing power (styles) from an external source (the CDN).
>
> ```html
> <link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.2/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
> ```
>
> - `href` = the URL/path of the external file (where to find it)
> - `rel="stylesheet"` = tells the browser "this is a CSS file"
> - This tag is **self-closing** — it has no `</link>` end tag

---

> 📌 **First Time Seeing `<body>`?**
>
> The `<body>` tag contains **everything that is visible** on the webpage — text, images, navbars, buttons, everything the user actually sees and interacts with.
>
> Think of it as the **pages inside a book** — the `<head>` is the cover info, but the `<body>` is the actual content people read.
>
> - There can only be **one** `<body>` per HTML file
> - All your visible content goes between `<body>` and `</body>`

---

> 📌 **First Time Seeing `<script>`?**
>
> The `<script>` tag is used to include **JavaScript** — the programming language that makes web pages interactive (dropdowns opening, hamburger menus toggling, form validation, etc.).
>
> Think of it as the **electrical wiring** of a building — you can't see it, but it makes the lights, fans, and switches work.
>
> ```html
> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.2/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script>
> ```
>
> - `src` = the URL/path of the JavaScript file
> - This loads Bootstrap's JavaScript (needed for dropdowns, collapse, etc.)
> - Placed at the **bottom** of `<body>` so the HTML loads first
> - Unlike `<link>`, the `<script>` tag **requires** a closing `</script>` tag

## 📖 Bootstrap Navbar — Building Block by Block

Now let's build the navbar, **one piece at a time**. Instead of dumping all the code on you, we'll add each part step by step, like building with LEGO blocks.

### Step 1: The `<nav>` Wrapper

Every navigation bar starts with the `<nav>` tag — a semantic HTML5 element that tells the browser (and screen readers) "this section contains navigation links."

```html
<nav class="navbar navbar-expand-lg navbar-dark bg-dark fixed-top">
    <!-- Everything goes inside here -->
</nav>
```

> 📌 **First Time Seeing `<nav>`?**
>
> The `<nav>` tag is a **semantic** element — it means "navigation." You *could* use a `<div>` instead, but `<nav>` tells browsers and screen readers exactly what this section is for.
>
> Think of it as labeling a door **"Reception"** instead of just **"Room 1"** — it communicates purpose, not just structure.

**Let's break down each Bootstrap class:**

| Class | What It Does | What CSS It Replaces |
|-------|-------------|---------------------|
| `navbar` | Marks this as a Bootstrap navbar component | Sets flexbox layout, padding, and alignment |
| `navbar-expand-lg` | Show full navbar on screens **≥ 992px** wide; collapse to hamburger on smaller screens | Complex media queries with `@media (min-width: 992px)` |
| `navbar-dark` | Makes the text/links **white** (for use on dark backgrounds) | `color: white;` on all nav links |
| `bg-dark` | Sets a **dark background** color (#212529) | `background-color: #212529;` |
| `fixed-top` | **Sticks** the navbar to the top of the screen — it stays visible even when you scroll | `position: fixed; top: 0; width: 100%; z-index: 1030;` |

> 💡 **What does "lg" in `navbar-expand-lg` mean?** Bootstrap has breakpoints:
>
> | Breakpoint | Code | Screen Width | Typical Device |
> |------------|------|-------------|----------------|
> | Extra small | (none) | < 576px | Small phones |
> | Small | `sm` | ≥ 576px | Large phones |
> | Medium | `md` | ≥ 768px | Tablets |
> | Large | `lg` | ≥ 992px | Laptops |
> | Extra large | `xl` | ≥ 1200px | Desktops |
> | XXL | `xxl` | ≥ 1400px | Large desktops |

---

### Step 2: The Container

Inside the `<nav>`, we add a **container** to constrain the content width and center it.

```html
<nav class="navbar navbar-expand-lg navbar-dark bg-dark fixed-top">
    <div class="container">
        <!-- Brand, toggler, and links go here -->
    </div>
</nav>
```

> 📌 **First Time Seeing `<div>`?**
>
> The `<div>` (short for "division") tag is the most generic **container** in HTML. By itself, it does nothing — it's just a box that groups elements together.
>
> Think of it as a **cardboard box** — it's not a table, not a chair, just a box you put things in to keep them organized.
>
> - `<div>` is a **block-level** element — it takes the full width and starts on a new line
> - It becomes useful when you add CSS classes to it (like Bootstrap's `container`)

**The `container` class** gives the content a maximum width and centers it on the page:
- On large screens, it adds margins on both sides so content doesn't stretch edge-to-edge
- On mobile, it uses full width with small padding
- Think of it as the **boundary walls of a garden** — it defines where your content lives

---

### Step 3: The Brand

The "brand" is the **website name or logo** that appears on the left side of the navbar.

```html
<a class="navbar-brand" href="#">BCA 2025-26</a>
```

> 📌 **First Time Seeing `<a>`?**
>
> The `<a>` tag (short for "anchor") creates a **clickable hyperlink**. It's one of the most important tags in HTML — it's what makes the web a "web" by connecting pages together.
>
> Think of it as a **signboard in a building** — "BCA Department → 2nd Floor." You see the label, you follow the direction.
>
> - `href` = the destination URL (where clicking takes you)
> - `href="#"` = a placeholder link (goes nowhere for now)
> - The text between `<a>` and `</a>` is what the user sees and clicks

**The `navbar-brand` class** makes the text larger and bolder than regular nav links — it's the highlighted name of your website.

---

### Step 4: The Toggler Button (Hamburger Menu ☰)

On mobile screens, we can't show all navigation links in a row — there's no space. So Bootstrap gives us a **toggler button** (the famous "hamburger" icon ☰) that, when clicked, reveals the hidden links.

```html
<button class="navbar-toggler" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#mainNav">
    <span class="navbar-toggler-icon"></span>
</button>
```

> 📌 **First Time Seeing `<button>`?**
>
> The `<button>` tag creates a **clickable button**. Unlike `<a>` (which navigates somewhere), a `<button>` performs an **action** — like opening a menu, submitting a form, or triggering a script.
>
> Think of it as a **doorbell** — you press it and something happens.
>
> - `type="button"` tells the browser this button doesn't submit a form — it just does an action

> 📌 **First Time Seeing `<span>`?**
>
> The `<span>` tag is an **inline container** — similar to `<div>`, but it doesn't start a new line. It's used to wrap small pieces of content for styling purposes.
>
> Think of it as a **highlighter pen** on text — it marks a small piece without affecting the layout around it.
>
> - In this case, `<span class="navbar-toggler-icon">` creates the three-line hamburger icon (☰) using Bootstrap CSS

**Key attributes explained:**

| Attribute | What It Does |
|-----------|-------------|
| `class="navbar-toggler"` | Styles this as Bootstrap's hamburger button |
| `data-bs-toggle="collapse"` | Tells Bootstrap JS: "When clicked, toggle (show/hide) a collapsible element" |
| `data-bs-target="#mainNav"` | Tells Bootstrap JS: "The element to collapse/expand has `id="mainNav"`" |
| `navbar-toggler-icon` | The three horizontal lines (☰) — created entirely with CSS, no image needed |

> 💡 **What are `data-bs-*` attributes?** These are **data attributes** that Bootstrap's JavaScript reads to know what to do. The `bs` stands for "Bootstrap." They replace JavaScript event handlers — you don't need to write `onclick` functions!

---

### Step 5: Collapsible Content

The links that will be shown/hidden on mobile devices are wrapped in a collapsible `<div>`:

```html
<div class="collapse navbar-collapse" id="mainNav">
    <!-- Navigation links go here -->
</div>
```

| Class/Attribute | What It Does |
|----------------|-------------|
| `collapse` | Hides the content by default on small screens |
| `navbar-collapse` | Styles the collapse specifically for navbar layout |
| `id="mainNav"` | A unique identifier — this is what `data-bs-target="#mainNav"` points to |

> 💡 The `id` attribute is like an **Aadhaar number** — it must be unique on the entire page. The toggler button uses this ID to know *which* element to show/hide.

---

### Step 6: Navigation Links

Inside the collapsible div, we create the actual navigation links using an **unordered list**:

```html
<ul class="navbar-nav ms-auto mb-2 mb-lg-0">
    <li class="nav-item">
        <a class="nav-link active" aria-current="page" href="#home">Home</a>
    </li>
    <li class="nav-item">
        <a class="nav-link" href="#about">About</a>
    </li>
    <!-- More links... -->
</ul>
```

> 📌 **First Time Seeing `<ul>`?**
>
> The `<ul>` tag creates an **unordered list** (bulleted list). Why use a list for navigation? Because navigation IS a list of destinations — it's semantically correct and great for accessibility.
>
> Think of it as a **menu card at a dhaba (roadside restaurant)** — it lists all available items.

> 📌 **First Time Seeing `<li>`?**
>
> The `<li>` tag defines a **single list item** inside `<ul>`. Each navigation link is one item on our menu.
>
> Think of it as **one dish on the menu card** — "Paneer Tikka — ₹180."

**Bootstrap classes explained:**

| Class | What It Does |
|-------|-------------|
| `navbar-nav` | Styles the `<ul>` as a horizontal navbar navigation (removes bullet points, sets flexbox) |
| `ms-auto` | **Pushes the links to the right side.** `ms` = margin-start (left margin in LTR languages). `auto` = take all available space. This pushes everything after it to the right edge |
| `mb-2` | Adds bottom margin of 0.5rem (spacing on mobile) |
| `mb-lg-0` | Removes bottom margin on large screens and above |
| `nav-item` | Marks each `<li>` as a navbar item |
| `nav-link` | Styles each `<a>` as a navbar link (proper padding, color, hover effects) |

---

### Step 7: Dropdown Menu

A dropdown is a menu that appears when you click on a link — like a **pull-down chart** in a classroom:

```html
<li class="nav-item dropdown">
    <a class="nav-link dropdown-toggle" href="#" role="button" data-bs-toggle="dropdown">
        More
    </a>
    <ul class="dropdown-menu dropdown-menu-end">
        <li><a class="dropdown-item" href="#faq">FAQ</a></li>
        <li><a class="dropdown-item" href="#">Login</a></li>
    </ul>
</li>
```

**Bootstrap classes explained:**

| Class | What It Does |
|-------|-------------|
| `dropdown` | Marks this `<li>` as a dropdown container |
| `dropdown-toggle` | Adds the small **▾ arrow** after the text |
| `data-bs-toggle="dropdown"` | Tells Bootstrap JS: "Clicking this opens a dropdown menu" |
| `dropdown-menu` | Styles the hidden menu that appears on click |
| `dropdown-menu-end` | Aligns the dropdown to the **right edge** (so it doesn't overflow off-screen) |
| `dropdown-item` | Styles each link inside the dropdown menu |

> 💡 **How does the dropdown work without writing JavaScript?** Bootstrap's JS (the `bootstrap.bundle.min.js` file we included) automatically listens for clicks on elements with `data-bs-toggle="dropdown"` and shows/hides the menu. This is the power of Bootstrap — interactive features with zero custom JavaScript!

---

### Step 8: Active Link

The "active" link tells the user **which page or section they're currently on**:

```html
<a class="nav-link active" aria-current="page" href="#home">Home</a>
```

| Class/Attribute | What It Does |
|----------------|-------------|
| `active` | Highlights the link (makes it brighter/bolder) to show it's the current page |
| `aria-current="page"` | An **accessibility attribute** that tells screen readers: "This is the current page." Visually impaired users using software like JAWS or NVDA will hear "Home, current page" |

> 💡 **What is ARIA?** ARIA stands for **Accessible Rich Internet Applications**. These are special HTML attributes that make your website usable for people with disabilities. Adding `aria-current` takes 2 seconds but makes a huge difference for someone who can't see the screen. Always be inclusive! 🤝

## 🔨 Let's Build! (Step-by-Step Lab)

Time to get your hands dirty! Follow these steps exactly:

### Step 1: Create the Project Folder

1. Open **File Explorer** on your computer
2. Navigate to your Desktop (or any preferred location)
3. Create a new folder called **`bca-class-website`**

### Step 2: Create the HTML File

1. Open **VS Code** (or Notepad++ if VS Code isn't installed)
2. Go to **File → New File**
3. Save it immediately as **`index.html`** inside the `bca-class-website` folder

> 💡 **Why `index.html`?** When a web server receives a request for a folder (like `www.example.com/`), it automatically looks for a file called `index.html`. It's the **default homepage** — like how a book opens to page 1 by default.

### Step 3: Type the HTML Boilerplate

Type the following (don't copy-paste — **typing helps you learn**):

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>BCA Batch 2025-26 | Our Class</title>
    <link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.2/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
</head>
<body>

    <!-- We'll add our navbar here in the next step -->

    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.2/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

### Step 4: Add the Navbar

Replace the comment `<!-- We'll add our navbar here in the next step -->` with the complete navbar code. Here's the **full, final code** for Session 1:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">

### Step 5: Save and Open in Chrome

1. Press **Ctrl + S** to save the file
2. Open **File Explorer**, navigate to your `bca-class-website` folder
3. Double-click **`index.html`** — it should open in your default browser
4. You should see the dark navbar at the top with all links!

### Step 6: Test Responsiveness

1. With the page open in Chrome, press **F12** to open Developer Tools
2. Click the **Toggle Device Toolbar** button (📱 icon) in the top-left of DevTools
3. Select a phone model like **iPhone 12 Pro** from the dropdown
4. You should see the navbar collapse into a **hamburger icon** (☰)!

### Step 7: Test the Hamburger

1. While in mobile view, **click the hamburger icon** (☰)
2. The navigation links should **slide down** and appear vertically
3. Click the hamburger again — they should **collapse back up**

### Step 8: Test the Dropdown

1. Switch back to desktop view (click the device toolbar icon again to toggle off)
2. Click on **"More"** in the navbar
3. A small menu should drop down showing **FAQ** and **Login**
4. Click anywhere else on the page — the dropdown should close

> 🎉 **Congratulations!** You've just built your first responsive navbar with Bootstrap! No CSS was written. No JavaScript was written. Just HTML classes. This is the power of frameworks!

## ✅ Checkpoint

At this point, your page should look like this:

### On Desktop (screen width ≥ 992px):

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  BCA 2025-26    Home  About  Faculty  Timetable  Gallery  Contact  More ▾│
├──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                                          │
│                     Welcome to BCA Batch 2025-26!                        │
│           Our class website is coming soon... one section at a time! 🚀  │
│                                                                          │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

- ✅ Dark navbar fixed at the top of the page
- ✅ "BCA 2025-26" brand text on the left
- ✅ All 6 links (Home, About, Faculty, Timetable, Gallery, Contact) visible on the right
- ✅ "More" dropdown with ▾ arrow — clicking it reveals FAQ and Login
- ✅ "Home" link appears slightly brighter (it's the `active` link)
- ✅ Navbar stays on top when you scroll down

### On Mobile (screen width < 992px):

```
┌──────────────────────┐
│  BCA 2025-26    ☰    │
├──────────────────────┤
│                      │
│    Welcome to BCA    │
│   Batch 2025-26!     │
│  Our class website   │
│  is coming soon...   │
│  one section at a    │
│  time! 🚀           │
│                      │
└──────────────────────┘
```

- ✅ Only the brand and hamburger icon are visible
- ✅ Clicking ☰ smoothly reveals all navigation links vertically
- ✅ Clicking ☰ again collapses them back
- ✅ The "More" dropdown works inside the collapsed menu too

### Common Issues and Fixes:

| Problem | Likely Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------------|-----|
| Navbar doesn't appear dark | Missing `bg-dark` or `navbar-dark` class | Check the `<nav>` tag classes |
| Hamburger doesn't work | Missing Bootstrap JS `<script>` tag | Add the JS Bundle link before `</body>` |
| Links don't push to the right | Missing `ms-auto` on the `<ul>` | Add `ms-auto` class |
| Content hidden behind navbar | Missing `padding-top: 80px` on the content below | Add the padding style |
| Dropdown doesn't open | `data-bs-target` doesn't match the `id` | Ensure the `#mainNav` matches in both places |

## 📝 Key Takeaways

1. **Bootstrap is a framework, not a language.** It's a collection of pre-written CSS and JavaScript that you use by adding classes to your HTML elements. You don't need to learn a new syntax — just know which class does what.

2. **The HTML boilerplate is your foundation.** Every web page starts with `<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>`. The `<meta viewport>` tag is essential for mobile responsiveness. Never skip it!

3. **Bootstrap's navbar is built from modular pieces.** Brand → Toggler → Collapse container → Nav links → Dropdowns. Each piece has its own class and role. Understanding this modularity is key.

4. **`data-bs-*` attributes are Bootstrap's magic.** Instead of writing JavaScript event handlers, you add data attributes like `data-bs-toggle="collapse"` and Bootstrap's JS does the rest. This is called **declarative programming** — you declare *what* should happen, not *how*.

5. **Responsive design means one codebase, all devices.** With `navbar-expand-lg`, the same navbar code shows a full menu on desktops and a hamburger on phones. You didn't write a single media query — Bootstrap handled it.

6. **Accessibility matters from Day 1.** Adding `aria-current="page"` takes 2 seconds but makes your website usable for visually impaired users. Good developers build for everyone. 🤝

## 🏋️ Practice Challenges

Test your understanding with these challenges. Try each one on your own before looking at hints!

### Challenge 1: Light Theme Navbar ☀️

**Task:** Change the navbar from a dark theme to a **light theme**.

**Hints:**
- Replace `navbar-dark` with `navbar-light`
- Replace `bg-dark` with `bg-light`
- Notice how the text color automatically changes from white to dark — that's Bootstrap being smart!

**Expected result:** A white/light grey navbar with dark text links.

---

### Challenge 2: Add a "Resources" Dropdown 📚

**Task:** Add another dropdown menu called **"Resources"** next to "More", with links to:
- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com) — `target="_blank"` (opens in new tab)
- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org) — `target="_blank"`

**Hints:**
- Copy the existing dropdown `<li>` block
- Change the text from "More" to "Resources"
- Use `target="_blank"` on the `<a>` tags to open links in a new tab

---

### Challenge 3: Brand with Emoji Badge 🎓

**Task:** Modify the navbar brand to include an emoji and make it more prominent:

```html
<a class="navbar-brand" href="#">🎓 BCA 2025-26</a>
```

**Bonus:** Try adding a small Bootstrap **badge** after the brand text:

```html
<a class="navbar-brand" href="#">BCA 2025-26 <span class="badge bg-warning text-dark">MU</span></a>
```
