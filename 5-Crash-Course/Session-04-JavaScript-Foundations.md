## 🎯 What We'll Build Today

Today is a **landmark day** — you're writing your **first JavaScript code!**

We won't add any new visual sections to our class website. Instead, we'll bring the existing page **to life** by adding **interactivity**:

| # | Feature | What It Does |
|---|---------|--------------|
| 1 | Welcome Alert | A pop-up greets visitors: "Welcome to BCA 2025-26! 🎓" |
| 2 | Console Message | A secret message visible only in DevTools (F12) |
| 3 | Personalized Greeting | A prompt asks "What is your name?" and displays a welcome message |
| 4 | Show/Hide Toggle | A button that shows or hides the info cards section |
| 5 | Click Counter | A button that counts how many times you've clicked it |

> **Why no new section?** Because JavaScript is a **completely new language**. Today we focus 100% on understanding how JavaScript works. The HTML stays the same — we just add **superpowers** to it.

---

## 📌 New Concepts Table

No new HTML tags today! Instead, here are the **JavaScript concepts** you'll learn:

| Concept | What It Does | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| `var` | Declares a variable (a named container for data) | `var name = "Rahul";` |
| `function` | Defines a reusable block of code | `function greet() { }` |
| `alert()` | Shows a pop-up message box | `alert("Hello!");` |
| `console.log()` | Prints a message in the DevTools console | `console.log("debug");` |
| `prompt()` | Asks the user for input via a dialog box | `prompt("Your name?");` |
| `document.getElementById()` | Finds an HTML element by its `id` attribute | `document.getElementById("msg")` |
| `.textContent` | Reads or changes the text inside an element | `el.textContent = "Hi";` |
| `.style.display` | Controls whether an element is visible or hidden | `el.style.display = "none";` |
| `onclick` | Runs a function when an element is clicked | `onclick="doSomething()"` |
| `if / else` | Makes decisions based on conditions | `if (age >= 18) { }` |

## 📖 What is JavaScript?

### The Three Languages of the Web

Think of building a webpage like building a **human body**:

| Language | Role | Body Analogy |
|----------|------|--------------|
| **HTML** | Structure & Content | 🦴 The **skeleton** — bones, organs, the framework |
| **CSS** | Appearance & Style | 👔 The **clothing** — colors, fonts, layout, beauty |
| **JavaScript** | Behavior & Interaction | 💪🧠 The **muscles and brain** — movement, reactions, thinking |

Without JavaScript, your webpage is like a **beautiful mannequin in a shop window** — it looks good, but it can't move, can't respond, can't think. JavaScript makes it **come alive**.

📌 **Key Insight:** HTML and CSS are **not** programming languages. HTML is a markup language (it marks up content). CSS is a styling language. JavaScript is a **real programming language** — it has variables, functions, loops, and logic.

### A Brief History

- **Created in 1995** by **Brendan Eich** at Netscape — in just **10 days!**
- Originally called "Mocha," then "LiveScript," then renamed to "JavaScript" (to ride the popularity of Java — they're NOT related!)
- Today it's the **#1 most popular programming language** in the world
- It runs inside **every web browser** — Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari — no installation needed

### Where Does JavaScript Run?

JavaScript runs inside the **browser** (Chrome, Firefox, Edge). When you open a webpage, the browser loads HTML first, then CSS, then runs JavaScript. This is called **"client-side"** JavaScript — it runs on the user's computer, not on a server.

---

## 📖 Adding JavaScript to HTML

There are two ways to add JavaScript to your webpage:

### Method 1: Internal Script (We'll use this today)

Place a `<script>` tag inside your HTML file:

```html
<body>
    <!-- Your HTML content here -->

    <script>
        alert("Hello from JavaScript!");
    </script>
</body>
```

### Method 2: External Script (We'll use this in Session 12)

Create a separate `.js` file and link it: `<script src="js/script.js"></script>`

📌 **Why do we place `<script>` at the END of `<body>`?**

Think of it like a **restaurant**. The HTML is the food being plated. JavaScript is the waiter. If the waiter tries to serve before the food is ready, there's nothing to give! Place `<script>` at the bottom so HTML loads first.

---

## 📖 Variables — Labeled Jars for Your Data

### What is a Variable?

📌 **Analogy: A variable is like a labeled jar in your kitchen.**

Imagine you have jars on your kitchen shelf:
- One jar is labeled **"Sugar"** — inside it, you keep sugar
- Another is labeled **"Tea Leaves"** — inside it, you keep tea leaves
- You can **change** what's inside (refill it), but the label stays

In JavaScript, a **variable** is a named container that stores a value:

```javascript
var studentName = "Rahul";      // Jar labeled "studentName" contains "Rahul"
var age = 20;                   // Jar labeled "age" contains 20
var isPresent = true;           // Jar labeled "isPresent" contains true
```

Breaking down the syntax: `var` (keyword) → `studentName` (label) → `=` (assignment) → `"Rahul"` (the value inside the jar).

### Naming Rules for Variables

| Rule | ✅ Valid | ❌ Invalid |
|------|---------|-----------|
| Use letters, numbers, `_`, `$` | `studentName` | `student-name` |
| Cannot start with a number | `age1` | `1age` |
| No spaces allowed | `firstName` | `first name` |
| Case-sensitive | `Name` ≠ `name` | — |
| Use **camelCase** convention | `totalMarks` | `TotalMarks`, `total_marks` |

📌 **What is camelCase?** It's like a camel's humps 🐫 — the first word is lowercase, and every next word starts with a capital letter: `myFirstVariable`, `studentRollNumber`, `isLoggedIn`.

### You Can Change a Variable's Value

```javascript
var city = "Mandsaur";
city = "Indore";            // No 'var' needed for reassignment
```

---

## 📖 Data Types — What Can Go Inside the Jar?

JavaScript has several data types, but today we'll focus on the **Big Three**:

### 1. String — Text Data

A string is text wrapped in quotes — think of it as a **garland of characters** strung together.

```javascript
var collegeName = "Mandsaur University";    // Double quotes ✅
var city = 'Mandsaur';                      // Single quotes ✅ — either works
```

📌 **Strings must be in quotes.** Without quotes, JavaScript thinks it's a variable name, not text.

### 2. Number — Numeric Data

Numbers are written **without** quotes:

```javascript
var totalStudents = 60;       // Integer (whole number)
var percentage = 85.5;        // Decimal (floating point)
```

📌 **Common Mistake:** `var age = "20";` is a **string** (quotes!). `var age = 20;` is a **number** (no quotes).

### 3. Boolean — True or False

A boolean is like a **light switch** — only `true` or `false`:

```javascript
var isStudent = true;          // Yes, they are a student
var hasSubmitted = false;      // No, they haven't submitted
```

📌 **When do we use booleans?** Whenever you need a yes/no answer: Is the user logged in? Has the form been submitted?

---

## 📖 Output Methods — Talking to the User (and Yourself)

JavaScript gives you several ways to display information:

### 1. `alert("message")` — The Pop-up Box

```javascript
alert("Welcome to BCA Batch 2025-26!");
```

📌 **Analogy:** An alert is like a **loudspeaker announcement** in college — everything stops until the announcement is over. Use sparingly — only for important one-time messages!

### 2. `console.log("message")` — The Developer's Secret Diary

```javascript
console.log("Page loaded successfully!");
console.log("Student count: " + 60);
```

📌 **Analogy:** `console.log` is like writing in your personal diary — **only you can see it**. Messages appear in the browser's **DevTools Console** (press F12). This is the most important tool for finding bugs!

### 3. `prompt("question")` — Asking the User

```javascript
var name = prompt("What is your name?");
```

📌 **Analogy:** A prompt is like a **teacher asking a question in class** — it waits for an answer. Returns what the user typed (as a string), `null` if they click Cancel, or `""` if they click OK without typing.

### 4. `document.write("message")` — Writing on the Page (Avoid!)

📌 **Warning:** `document.write("Hello!")` writes directly on the page but **overwrites everything** if used after the page loads. It's rarely used in practice — you'll see it in textbooks, but always use DOM manipulation instead.

---

## 📖 The DOM — Your Page's Family Tree

### What is the DOM?

**DOM** stands for **Document Object Model**. It's the browser's internal representation of your HTML page as a **tree of objects**.

📌 **Analogy: The DOM is like a family tree.**

```
document (👴 Great-Grandparent)
  └── html (👨 Grandparent)
        ├── head (👩 Parent)
        │     ├── title
        │     └── meta
        └── body (👨 Parent)
              ├── nav
              ├── div (hero)
              ├── section (about)
              └── script
```

Every HTML tag becomes a **node** (a member) in this tree. JavaScript can:
- **Find** any node: "Where is the element with id 'welcomeMessage'?"
- **Read** its content: "What text does it contain?"
- **Change** its content: "Replace that text with something new!"
- **Hide/Show** it: "Make this element invisible!"

### `document.getElementById("id")` — Finding an Element

This is the most important DOM method you'll learn today.

```javascript
var heading = document.getElementById("mainTitle");
```

📌 **Analogy:** Think of `getElementById` as calling someone by their **roll number** in class. Every student (element) has a unique roll number (id). When the teacher (JavaScript) calls "Roll number 15!", exactly one student responds.

**Important:** The `id` must match **exactly** (case-sensitive), and each `id` must be unique on the page.

### `.textContent` — Reading or Changing Text

```javascript
var currentText = document.getElementById("mainTitle").textContent;   // Read
document.getElementById("mainTitle").textContent = "Welcome to BCA!"; // Change
```

### `.style.display` — Hiding and Showing Elements

```javascript
document.getElementById("infoCards").style.display = "none";   // Hide
document.getElementById("infoCards").style.display = "block";  // Show
```

📌 **Analogy:** `.style.display = "none"` is like putting a **blanket over a TV** — the TV is still there, but you can't see it. `.style.display = "block"` removes the blanket.

---

## 📖 Functions — Reusable Recipes

### What is a Function?

📌 **Analogy: A function is like a recipe for making chai.**

You write the recipe once:
```
Recipe: makeChai
  1. Boil water
  2. Add tea leaves
  3. Add milk and sugar
  4. Strain and serve
```

Then whenever someone wants chai, you just say **"makeChai!"** — you don't rewrite the recipe every time.

In JavaScript:

```javascript
function makeChai() {
    console.log("Boil water, add tea leaves, add milk, strain and serve!");
}

makeChai();   // Calling the function (actually making the chai)
```

### Function Syntax

```javascript
function greet() {         // 'function' keyword + name + parentheses
    // Code to run goes inside { curly braces }
}
```

### Functions with Parameters

Parameters are like **ingredients** you pass to the recipe:

```javascript
function greet(studentName) {
    alert("Namaste, " + studentName + "! Welcome to class.");
}

greet("Rahul");    // Namaste, Rahul! Welcome to class.
greet("Priya");    // Namaste, Priya! Welcome to class.
```

📌 **`studentName` is the parameter** — a placeholder replaced with the actual value when you call the function.

---

## 📖 Events — When Things Happen

### What is an Event?

📌 **Analogy: Events are like doorbells.** When someone presses your doorbell (the event), you open the door (the response). In JavaScript, when a user **clicks** a button (the event), a **function runs** (the response).

### The `onclick` Event

```html
<button onclick="sayHello()">Click Me</button>

<script>
function sayHello() {
    alert("Hello! You clicked the button!");
}
</script>
```

User clicks the button → **click event fires** → browser sees `onclick="sayHello()"` → calls the function → alert appears.

---

## 📖 if/else — Making Decisions

### What is if/else?

📌 **Analogy:** `if/else` is like a **traffic signal**:
- **If** the light is green → drive
- **Else** → stop

In JavaScript:

```javascript
var marks = 75;

if (marks >= 40) {
    console.log("Pass! Congratulations! 🎉");
} else {
    console.log("Fail. Better luck next time.");
}
```

### Comparison Operators

| Operator | Meaning | Example | Result |
|----------|---------|---------|--------|
| `===` | Strictly equal to | `5 === 5` | `true` |
| `!==` | Not equal to | `5 !== 3` | `true` |
| `>` | Greater than | `10 > 5` | `true` |
| `<` | Less than | `3 < 7` | `true` |
| `>=` | Greater than or equal | `5 >= 5` | `true` |
| `<=` | Less than or equal | `3 <= 2` | `false` |

📌 **Why `===` and not `==`?**

`==` (loose equality) does type conversion, which leads to **surprises**:
```javascript
"5" == 5      // true  (JavaScript converts the string to a number — confusing!)
"5" === 5     // false (different types: string vs number — correct!)
```

**Rule: Always use `===` (strict equality).** It checks both the value AND the type. No surprises.

## 🔨 Let's Build! Step-by-Step Lab

Time to add JavaScript to our class website! Open the `index.html` you've been building since Session 1.

### Step 1: Review Your Current Page

Your page from Sessions 1-3 should have: a responsive navbar, hero carousel (3 slides), about section (2-column grid), and three info cards. If anything is missing, the complete code below has everything.

### Step 2: Add a Welcome Message Placeholder

Right **after** the hero carousel section and **before** the about section, add this paragraph:

```html
<!-- Welcome Message (Updated by JavaScript) -->
<p id="welcomeMessage" class="text-center text-muted fs-5 my-3">Welcome, visitor! 👋</p>
```

📌 **Why do we add this?** JavaScript will find this element by its `id` and change its text to show the visitor's name.

### Step 3: Wrap Info Cards and Add Toggle Button

Find your three info cards (Vision, Mission, Values). Add a toggle button above them, and wrap the cards row with `id="infoCards"`:

```html
<button id="toggleBtn" class="btn btn-outline-primary mb-3" onclick="toggleCards()">
    Hide Info Cards
</button>

<div id="infoCards" class="row g-4">
    <!-- Your 3 cards (Vision, Mission, Values) go here -->
</div>
```

### Step 4: Add a Click Counter Section

Right **after** the about section, add this small section:

```html
<!-- Click Counter Section -->
<div class="container text-center my-4">
    <h5>🖱️ Click Counter Challenge</h5>
    <button class="btn btn-success btn-lg" onclick="countClicks()">Click Me!</button>
    <p id="clickResult" class="mt-2 fs-5 text-primary">You clicked 0 times!</p>
</div>
```

### Step 5: Add the `<script>` Tag

Add a `<script>` tag just **before** the Bootstrap JS CDN link at the bottom of `<body>`. This is where ALL our JavaScript goes.

### Step 6: Add the Welcome Alert (Lab 18 ✅)

Inside the `<script>` tag, add:

```javascript
// 1. Welcome Alert — shows a popup when the page loads
alert("Welcome to BCA Batch 2025-26! 🎓");
```

📌 **What happens:** As soon as the browser reaches this line, it pauses everything and shows a popup. The page won't finish rendering until the user clicks "OK."

**Save the file and open it in the browser. You should see the alert!**

### Step 7: Add a Console Message

Below the alert, add:

```javascript
// 2. Console Message — only visible in DevTools
console.log("✅ Page loaded successfully!");
console.log("Session 4: JavaScript Foundations");
console.log("Student count: " + 60);
```

📌 **How to see it:** Press **F12** (or right-click → Inspect → Console tab). You'll see your messages there. This is your **debugging tool** — use it constantly!

### Step 8: Add the Name Prompt

Below the console messages, add:

```javascript
// 3. Personalized Welcome — ask for the visitor's name
var visitorName = prompt("What is your name?");

if (visitorName !== null && visitorName !== "") {
    document.getElementById("welcomeMessage").textContent = "Welcome, " + visitorName + "! 👋";
    console.log("Visitor name: " + visitorName);
} else {
    console.log("Visitor skipped the name prompt.");
}
```

📌 **How it works:** `prompt()` asks for the name → stores it in `visitorName` → the `if` checks that the user didn't cancel or leave it blank → `getElementById` finds the welcome paragraph → `.textContent` changes its text → the `+` operator joins strings: `"Welcome, " + "Rahul" + "! 👋"` → `"Welcome, Rahul! 👋"`

### Step 9: Add the Toggle Cards Function (Lab 21 ✅)

Below the prompt code, add:

```javascript
// 4. Toggle Info Cards — show/hide the Vision, Mission, Values cards
function toggleCards() {
    var cards = document.getElementById("infoCards");
    var btn = document.getElementById("toggleBtn");

    if (cards.style.display === "none") {
        cards.style.display = "flex";
        btn.textContent = "Hide Info Cards";
        console.log("Info cards: SHOWN");
    } else {
        cards.style.display = "none";
        btn.textContent = "Show Info Cards";
        console.log("Info cards: HIDDEN");
    }
}
```

📌 **How it works:** We check `cards.style.display` — if `"none"`, we set it to `"flex"` (Bootstrap rows use flexbox) and update the button text. Otherwise, we hide the cards. Console logs help us debug.

### Step 10: Add the Click Counter

Below the toggle function, add:

```javascript
// 5. Click Counter — counts how many times the button is clicked
var clickCount = 0;

function countClicks() {
    clickCount = clickCount + 1;
    document.getElementById("clickResult").textContent = "You clicked " + clickCount + " times!";
    console.log("Click count: " + clickCount);
}
```

📌 **Key detail:** `var clickCount = 0;` is declared **outside** the function — so it persists between clicks. If it were inside, it would reset to 0 every time!

## ✅ Checkpoint — Verify Your Work

Open `index.html` in the browser and check each feature:

| # | Test | Expected Result | ✅ / ❌ |
|---|------|----------------|---------|
| 1 | Page loads | An alert pops up saying "Welcome to BCA Batch 2025-26! 🎓" | |
| 2 | Click OK on alert | A prompt asks "What is your name?" | |
| 3 | Type your name and click OK | The text below the carousel changes to "Welcome, [your name]! 👋" | |
| 4 | Press F12 → Console tab | You see "✅ Page loaded successfully!" and other log messages | |
| 5 | Click "Hide Info Cards" button | The three cards (Vision, Mission, Values) disappear, button says "Show Info Cards" | |
| 6 | Click "Show Info Cards" button | The cards reappear, button says "Hide Info Cards" | |
| 7 | Click the green "Click Me!" button | The counter text updates: "You clicked 1 times!", "You clicked 2 times!", etc. | |
| 8 | Check console while clicking | Each click logs "Click count: X" in the console | |

📌 **Troubleshooting Tips:**
- **Alert not showing?** Make sure your `<script>` tag is inside `<body>`, not `<head>`
- **Welcome message not changing?** Check that you have `id="welcomeMessage"` on the `<p>` tag (case-sensitive!)
- **Toggle not working?** Make sure the cards wrapper has `id="infoCards"` and the button has `onclick="toggleCards()"`
- **Console empty?** Press F12 and make sure you're on the **Console** tab, not Elements

## 🔍 JavaScript Quick Reference

### Output Methods

| Method | Shows Where | Pauses Page? | Use For |
|--------|------------|--------------|---------|
| `alert("msg")` | Pop-up box | ✅ Yes | Important one-time messages |
| `console.log("msg")` | DevTools Console (F12) | ❌ No | Debugging, logging values |
| `prompt("question")` | Input dialog box | ✅ Yes | Getting user input |
| `document.write("msg")` | Directly on page | ❌ No | Rarely used (avoid!) |

### Variable Declaration

| Syntax | Example | Notes |
|--------|---------|-------|
| `var name = value;` | `var age = 20;` | Use `var` in this course (ES5 style) |
| Reassign | `age = 21;` | No `var` needed for reassignment |
| String | `var x = "text";` | Always use quotes for text |
| Number | `var x = 42;` | No quotes for numbers |
| Boolean | `var x = true;` | Only `true` or `false` |

### DOM Manipulation

| Method | What It Does | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `document.getElementById("id")` | Finds element by id | `var el = document.getElementById("msg");` |
| `.textContent` | Get/set text content | `el.textContent = "Hello!";` |
| `.style.display = "none"` | Hide element | Makes element invisible |
| `.style.display = "block"` | Show element | Makes element visible |
| `.style.display = "flex"` | Show as flex container | For Bootstrap rows |

### Function & Event Syntax

```javascript
function name(param) { /* code */ }   // Declare
name(value);                           // Call
```
```html
<button onclick="name()">Click</button>  <!-- Event binding -->
```

## 📝 Key Takeaways

1. **JavaScript is the programming language of the web** — it adds behavior and interactivity.
2. **Place `<script>` at the end of `<body>`** — so HTML loads before JavaScript runs.
3. **Variables (`var`) are labeled containers** — they store strings, numbers, and booleans.
4. **`console.log()` is your best debugging friend** — use it constantly to check your code.
5. **The DOM is the browser's tree of your HTML** — use `document.getElementById()` to find and modify elements.
6. **Functions are reusable recipes** — write once, call many times.
7. **Events (`onclick`) connect user actions to functions** — click triggers code.
8. **`if/else` lets your code make decisions** — different conditions, different actions.
9. **Always use `===` (strict equality)** — avoids unexpected type conversion bugs.
10. **String concatenation uses `+`** — `"Hello, " + name + "!"` joins text and variables.

## 🏋️ Practice Challenges

Try these on your own to strengthen your JavaScript skills:

### Challenge 1: Age Display (Easy)
Add a **second prompt** after the name prompt that asks `"What is your age?"`. Display both the name and age in the welcome message:
```
"Welcome, Rahul (Age: 20)! 👋"
```

**Hint:** Use another `var` and string concatenation with `+`.

### Challenge 2: Navbar Color Changer (Medium)
Add a button below the click counter that says **"Change Navbar Color"**. When clicked, it should change the navbar's background color to a different color.

**Hint:** You'll need to:
1. Add an `id` to the `<nav>` tag
2. Use `document.getElementById("navId").style.backgroundColor = "blue";`
3. Create a function and connect it with `onclick`

### Challenge 3: Auto-Reset Counter (Medium)
Modify the click counter so that it **resets back to 0 after reaching 10 clicks**. When it resets, show an alert: `"Counter reset! You clicked 10 times!"`.

**Hint:** Add an `if` check inside `countClicks()`:
```javascript
if (clickCount > 10) {
    clickCount = 0;
    alert("Counter reset! You clicked 10 times!");
}
```
